Stock market portfolio optimization is the process of selecting the best combination of stocks to maximize returns while minimizing the risk, based on historical performance data and financial metrics.
Stock market portfolio optimization involves analyzing price trends, calculating expected returns and volatilities, and determining the correlations between different stocks to achieve diversification. Using techniques such as Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT), We can construct an efficient portfolio.
The expected results from stock market portfolio optimization include identifying the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, which indicates the best risk-adjusted return and provides a clear allocation strategy for the selected stocks to achieve long-term investment goals.
Now, We can use yfinance API for collecting stock market data.
